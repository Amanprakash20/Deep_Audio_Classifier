# Deep Audio Classifier
Welcome to my Deep Audio Classifier project! This is a cool little experiment I worked on where I used deep learning to identify Capuchinbird calls from audio recordings. It's built with Python and TensorFlow, and it was a fun way for me to dive deeper into audio processing and machine learning.

## What’s this about?
This project uses deep learning to classify bird sounds, specifically the calls of Capuchinbirds (yes, that's a real bird). I trained a model to recognize these calls from audio clips and even managed to process long recordings using a sliding window technique. The output is a CSV file showing when the bird calls happen. Pretty neat, right?

## How it’s set up
Here’s a quick rundown of the project structure:

## Deep-Audio-Classifier/
│
├── data/               # Where the audio files live
├── models/             # Saved models
├── notebooks/          # Jupyter Notebooks for experiments
├── scripts/            # Python scripts for training and testing
├── results/            # Output files go here
└── README.md           # You’re looking at it :)

## Getting Started
If you want to try this out on your own, here’s how to set it up:

1.Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Deep-Audio-Classifier.git
2.Jump into the folder: cd Deep-Audio-Classifier
3.Install the dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt

## The Data Process
Load the Audio: The project uses librosa to load the audio files.
Extract Features: I used MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) and spectrograms to turn the audio into something the model can understand.
Data Augmentation: I threw in some noise and shifted the audio around a bit to help the model generalize better.
Sliding Window: For long recordings, this technique breaks the audio into chunks, so the model can listen and classify smaller sections.
How the Model Works
The model is a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow. Here’s a basic outline:

Input Layer: Takes the extracted audio features (MFCC or spectrogram).
Convolutional Layers: These help the model recognize patterns in the audio.
Dense Layers: These process the extracted features.
Output Layer: Gives the classification: bird call or no bird call.

## Training and Results
I trained the model on a bunch of audio clips and got some decent results. The accuracy was pretty good, and it could pick out the bird calls with high precision. Here’s a sample output:
Time (s)   | Detected Call
---------------------------
3.5        | Yes
15.7       | Yes

What’s Next?
Maybe I’ll try adding some more advanced features, like RNNs to handle sequences better.
I’m thinking about optimizing the model further or trying to deploy it in a more user-friendly way.
