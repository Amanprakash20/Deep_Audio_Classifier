# Deep_Audio_Classifier
This project is focused on classifying Capuchinbird calls from audio recordings. It uses TensorFlow and TensorFlow I/O for handling audio files, including resampling and preprocessing to convert raw audio into spectrograms. The model is trained to differentiate between Capuchinbird calls and other background noise, with the goal of accurately predicting bird calls in long-duration forest recordings.
