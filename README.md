# Deep_Audio_Classifier
This project classifies Capuchinbird calls from audio recordings using TensorFlow and TensorFlow I/O. It handles audio preprocessing, including resampling and converting audio into spectrograms. The model is trained to differentiate between Capuchinbird calls and background noise, aiming to predict bird calls in long-duration forest recordings.
